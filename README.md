# Masters Bioinformatics Pipelines

This repository contains scripts developed for my MSc research on Cape fur seal evolutionary genomics. It includes pipelines for processing raw sequencing data, read alignment, SNP calling, and population genomics analyses.

All raw data will be available via SRA once the publication is released; details can be found in the forthcoming publication.
